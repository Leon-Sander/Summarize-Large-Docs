They explain that chatbots rely on AI or a knowledge base to respond and answer questions. The author provides three use cases for chatbots: answering questions for customers, serving as an internal resource for staff training, and using third-party data to create persona bots. They emphasize the need for a strict knowledge base to ensure accurate and controlled responses. The author also suggests using websites, documents (such as PDFs and Word docs), and plain text to build the knowledge base. They recommend using free tools like Chat GPT, YouTube, and copy and paste to supercharge the knowledge base. The author provides a step-by-step guide on how to create a knowledge base using Bot Press as an example.

      "- The author is explaining how to build a knowledge base for a chatbot.\n",

      "- They start by copying and pasting information from the hotel's website into a Word document.\n",
      "- They then use a plugin in ChatGPT to scrape more information from the hotel's page on booking.com.\n",
      "- They use ChatGPT to generate additional FAQs based on the information gathered.\n",
      "- They suggest using YouTube to gather more information about attractions, such as the London Eye.\n",

      "The text discusses the process of creating a knowledge base for a chatbot using YouTube videos. The author explains that instead of copying and pasting information from Google, they decided to scrape data from a highly-rated YouTube video about attractions in London. They used a website called YouTube transcript.com to transcribe the video into text, which they then copied and pasted into their knowledge base. The author highlights the usefulness of this method for building a knowledge base quickly and easily. They also mention the potential for using this approach with other types of videos and documents. The text concludes with the author demonstrating how the chatbot can retrieve information from the knowledge base in a conversation.```\n",

However, it requires many more calls to the LLM than Stuffing, and these calls are not independent, meaning they cannot be parallelized. Additionally, there is some potential dependency on the ordering of the documents. Latest documents they might become more relevant as this method suffers from recency bias."

    "\n",
    "In this notebook you learn about different techniques to summarize long documents with LangChain. What you have seen in this notebook are only some of the possibilities you have. For example, there is another method called the Map-Rerank method which involves running an initial prompt on each chunk of data, which not only tries to complete a task but also gives a score for how certain it is in its answer. The responses are then ranked according to this score, and the highest score is returned.\n",

    " - More control to customize your generative applications based on your scenario.\n",
